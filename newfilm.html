<p>By the time&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>&nbsp;hits theaters in July 2019, it will likely be actor&nbsp;Tom Holland&lsquo;s fifth turn as the web-slinging superhero. Given how intense the first three films have been (particularly&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>), fans will be expecting an impressive adventure from the actor&rsquo;s second solo(ish) outing, and Marvel Studios appears to be filling out the cast of the high-profile sequel with that in mind.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;director Jon Watts returning behind the camera, the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>&nbsp;will be set after the events of&nbsp;<em>Infinity War</em>&nbsp;and its&nbsp;May 2019&nbsp;<em>Endgame</em>sequel, and will take the famous wall-crawler on a globe-spanning adventure. And now the first trailer for the film and some new posters have&nbsp;finally been released, confirming that everyone&rsquo;s favorite web-slinger is still swinging around the Marvel Cinematic Universe &mdash; particularly Europe &mdash; after the events of&nbsp;<em>Infinity War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame.</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything we know about&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Far from Home</em>&nbsp;so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong><em>&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home</em></li>
<li><strong>Release date</strong>:&nbsp;July 5, 2019</li>
<li><strong>Cast</strong>: Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Marisa Tomei, Zendaya, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders</li>
<li><strong>Director</strong>:&nbsp;Jon Watts</li>
</ul>
<h2>THE POSTERS</h2>
<p>Between the arrival of&nbsp;<em>Captain Marvel</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>&lsquo;s big finale, Marvel wanted to make sure that fans don&rsquo;t forget that Spidey has a movie coming in 2019, too. To that end, the studio released&nbsp;three posters&nbsp;teasing how Peter Parker will spend his European summer vacation with shots of Spider-Man hanging around Venice, Berlin, and London.</p>

<h2>THE TRAILER</h2>
<p>The first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>&nbsp;(see above) was released January 15, and offered the first look at Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, as well as the return of several characters from the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<h2>THE VILLAIN</h2>
<p>Many of the details surrounding Jake Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s role in the film &mdash; beyond the identity of the character, at least &mdash; have remained a closely guarded mystery. Apparently, that secrecy extends to Gyllenhaal himself, who used his&nbsp;first post on Instagram&nbsp;to reveal his reaction upon discovering that he was not, in fact, playing Spider-Man in the film.</p>
<p>Gyllenhaal can be seen reading a copy of&nbsp;<em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>&nbsp;featuring the character Mysterio on the cover, only to express his shock and dismay when it becomes clear that he won&rsquo;t be playing the web-slinging star of film.</p>
<p>In September, a series of&nbsp;unofficial photos&nbsp;that found their way online near the end of September that appear to show Gyllenhaal in costume &mdash; and it&rsquo;s a surprisingly elaborate costume &mdash; as the villain&nbsp;Mysterio.</p>

<div>Several months earlier,&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;first announced that Gyllenhaal was in talks to portray Mysterio, a frequent foe of Spider-Man in the Marvel Comics universe.</div>

<p>Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first introduced in a 1964 issue of&nbsp;<em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>, Mysterio is the alter ego of Quentin Beck, a special effects expert who uses his talents to pull off elaborate crimes. Mysterio is considered one of Spider-Man&rsquo;s most troublesome enemies, as he often makes Spider-Man question his own senses and perception of the world around him, relying more on psychological and chemical weapons than physical attacks.</p>
<p>This will be Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s first, official role in a mainstream superhero movie after coming close to landing the lead roles in both the original Spider-Man franchise and Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Dark Knight trilogy.</p>
<h2>THE SUIT</h2>
<p>Spider-Man is getting a new suit when he returns to the big screen, and a set of photos and video that found their way online in October offered the first look at the web-slinger&rsquo;s new costume. The photos and video were posted on Instagram by a pair of fan sites that were able to get a look at the set of the film, and show off Spider-Man&rsquo;s new red-and-black suit for&nbsp;<em>Far From Home</em>.</p>
<h2>HE CAST</h2>
<p>First and foremost among the returning cast members is Tom Holland in the role of Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man), who made his debut as the character in 2016&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.</p>

<p>Holland will be joined in the returning cast from&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;</em>by Marisa Tomei as Peter&rsquo;s aunt, May Parker; Zendaya as Michelle &ldquo;M.J.&rdquo; Jones; Jacob Batalon as Ned, Peter&rsquo;s best friend; and Tony Revolori as Eugene &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; Thompson, Peter&rsquo;s high-school rival. Michael Keaton is rumored to be reprising his role as Adrian Toomes, the villain known as The Vulture.</p>
<p>From the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders will reportedly&nbsp;reprise their roles&nbsp;as SHIELD director Nick Fury and agent Maria Hill, respectively. The pair did not appear in&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>&nbsp;but were last seen in one of the post-credits scenes in&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>. Young Nick Fury also played a big part in&nbsp;<em>Captain Marvel</em>, which doubled as an origin story for the entire MCU.</p>

<p>As for the film&rsquo;s villain, Jake Gyllenhaal joined the cast in May 2018 as Mysterio, an illusion-manipulating villain and one of Spider-Man&rsquo;s recurring foes in Marvel Comics history.</p>
<h2>THE STORY</h2>
<p>One thing we know for sure about the plot of&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>&nbsp;is that it will live up to its title by taking the adventure well outside the U.S.</p>
<figure><img src="https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/spider-man-homecoming-review-pipe-720x720.jpg" /></figure>
<p>In April 2018, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige told&nbsp;Gizmodo&rsquo;s i09&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>Far From Home</em>&nbsp;would shoot&nbsp;in London and surrounding areas in the U.K. Although he didn&rsquo;t give any clues as to what stamps Peter will be adding to his passport, he did strongly hint that the reason for the web-slinger&rsquo;s travel will be related to the events of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>.&nbsp;The Marvel president noted that&nbsp;<em>Civil War</em>&nbsp;set up&nbsp;<em>Homecoming</em>&nbsp;and said that the two Avengers films &ldquo;will greatly inform&rdquo; the upcoming Spider-Man flick &mdash; &ldquo;probably even more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that Peter will be doing some globetrotting, Feige highlighted in an interview with&nbsp;IGN Africa&nbsp;that we&rsquo;ll see the superhero trying to return to &ldquo;normal life.&rdquo; He pointed out how Peter is &ldquo;one of us&rdquo; and &ldquo;is, quote-unquote, a normal person&rdquo; despite having powers. To capture that, the sequel will show him back at school and settling into his &ldquo;normal environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun to see that, because he can represent, you know, the world as a whole, as they try to move forward,&rdquo; Feige said. &ldquo;And you can do it in a way that is tonally unique, and tonally different than, certainly, the two Avengers films that people are about to see.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE TITLE</h2>
<p>In June, Holland posted a video to Instagram in which he revealed the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Homecoming</em>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Far From Home.&nbsp;</em>Feige later&nbsp;confirmed the title.</p>
