	<h2>HISTORY OF THANOS</h2>
<img src="tha1.jpg">
<p>Thanos&nbsp;debuted in&nbsp;<em>Iron Man</em>&nbsp;#55, in February of 1973. Born Dione on Saturn&rsquo;s moon of Titan, Thanos grew up in a peace-loving family. However, he began experimenting on other Titans, which increased Thanos&rsquo; obsession with death and genetic experimentation. Possessing the DNA of the&nbsp;Deviants&nbsp;and&nbsp;Eternals&nbsp;made Thanos extremely powerful and resilient. At one point, Thanos exposed himself to cosmic rays, which distorted his body.</p>
<p>He eventually killed many of his fellow Titans, including his own mother. This further twisted his mind and increased his lust for death. Marvel introduced the character of&nbsp;Death&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Captain Marvel</em>&nbsp;#26, just three months later, in May of 1973. As the embodiment of Death, Thanos found a woman whom he could both love and worship. His desire to please her led him to commit greater acts of murder and tyranny.</p>
<p>This included&nbsp;Thanos&rsquo; quest for the soul gems&nbsp;(AKA the Infinity Stones), his ability to manipulate time to acquire them, and the subsequent death of half the Marvel Universe. These storylines and many others in Marvel Comics showcased just how powerful and determined he was to &ldquo;court death.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THANOS&rsquo; POWERS</h2>

<img src="tha2.jpg">
<p>Thanos possesses numerous powers in the comics. Firstly, he is extremely strong. The absorption of cosmic rays combined with his own eternal DNA makes him super strong. He is also incredibly smart. When Thanos wanted Adam Warlock&rsquo;s soul gem, he rearranged time and waited decades for events to play out in his favor.</p>
<p>In certain comic book storylines, Thanos possessed mind control, telepathy, and teleportation.&nbsp;He was deemed a &ldquo;Category 1 Life Ender&rdquo; by the Nova Corps and he is categorized at a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; threat level, according to&nbsp;<em>Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files</em>. He stands at a tall 6&prime; 7&Prime; and weighs almost 1,000 lbs.</p>
<p>In short, Thanos is not someone to trifle with. He has the DNA of the Eternals, he can be (and has been) resurrected by Death, he is a master manipulator, and he has incredible patience &mdash; he&rsquo;s is willing to wait for whatever he is planning.&nbsp;Based on the trailers for&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War,</em>&nbsp;Thanos clearly possesses the same level of strength that he does in the comics &mdash; he also can teleport, at least through those portals. Can he mess with time? Can he use mind control? All of that is very likely, especially if his dealings with Loki and Ronan provide any clues.&nbsp;He should be the toughest villains the Avengers have ever faced. This was true in the comics and will likely be true for the upcoming film.</p>
<p><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>&nbsp;hits theaters on April 27, 2018.</p>
