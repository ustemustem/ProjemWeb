	<h1>HISTORY OF AVENGERS</h1>
<dd>"<em>There was an idea... called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could.</em>"</dd>

</div>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Avengers</strong>&nbsp;are a team of superheroes assembled by&nbsp;Nick Fury&nbsp;and the intelligence agency&nbsp;S.H.I.E.L.D.&nbsp;through the&nbsp;Avengers Initiative.</p>
<p>The team currently consists of officially&nbsp;Iron Man&nbsp;and&nbsp;War Machine, while unofficially other members include&nbsp;Captain America,&nbsp;Black Widow,&nbsp;Rocket Raccoon,&nbsp;Hulk&nbsp;and&nbsp;Thor Odinson.&nbsp;The original team consisted of&nbsp;Iron Man, Captain America,&nbsp;Hulk,&nbsp;Thor, Black Widow and&nbsp;Hawkeye&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>The Avengers</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, and shifted when Tony Stark, Thor, Clint Barton, and Bruce Banner/Hulk&nbsp;left the team after the events of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>. They were initially brought together by&nbsp;S.H.I.E.L.D.&nbsp;to combat&nbsp;Loki, Thor's adoptive brother. The team was initially formed by Nick Fury to "fight the battles that S.H.I.E.L.D. never could".</p>
<p>The Avengers were disbanded, due to the actions of Tony Stark; who betrayed his former team to enforce the&nbsp;Sokovia Accords, but a small group consisting of Captain America, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow and Falcon continued to operate in the shadows.</p>
<p>As of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, the Avengers have been reassembled by Steve, but most have been left dead due to&nbsp;Thanos' snap.</p>

<p>Avengers Assemble!</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nick Fury assembles the team when an unexpected threat associated with Thor's brother&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Tesseract&nbsp;appears. The team initially have difficulty and refusal to obey each other; for example, Tony Stark is reluctant to working under the command of Captain America, Thor demands that Loki is his responsibility and the team is uncomfortable with the presence of Bruce Banner. When Loki attempts to destroy the team and promote his godlike supremacy to Earth in a public way, the Avengers depart from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s command and rally in defense of New York as it is invaded by the extraterrestrials known as the&nbsp;Chitauri. Captain America takes command of the team and they each work to suppress the invasion force. The Hulk beats Loki into submission and Iron Man sends a nuclear weapon fired by the World Security Council into the portal through which the aliens enter Earth and their fleet is destroyed, breaking the neural connection with their ground troops and instantly killing them. The team take Loki as their prisoner and Thor takes both Loki and the Tesseract back to&nbsp;Asgard. The team disbands but agrees to reassemble when another global threat requires their combined efforts.</p>
<h3><em>Iron Man 3</em></h3>
<p>The team was mentioned by&nbsp;Harold Hogan&nbsp;as the "Super Friends"&nbsp;and were mentioned once more by&nbsp;Harley Keener.</p>
<h3><em>Thor: The Dark World</em></h3>
<p>The team was mentioned by&nbsp;Loki, who disguises himself as one of Thor's "new friends" Captain America.</p>
<h3><em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em></h3>
<p>The team are mentioned by the&nbsp;World Security Council&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wolfgang von Strucker. Several members, such as Tony, Bruce, and Steve, were targeted by&nbsp;Project Insight&nbsp;as potential threats to&nbsp;HYDRA&nbsp;and their new world order. Steve and Natasha, along with their allies&nbsp;Sam Wilson,&nbsp;Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, take down HYDRA, but also SHIELD as a result.</p>
<h3><em>Avengers: Operation HYDRA</em></h3>
<p><em>To be added</em></p>
<h3><em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em></h3>
<p>After the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., Loki's Scepter fell into the hands of HYDRA. The threat it posed drew the Avengers back together in a desperate worldwide hunt. The Avengers had the financial backing of Tony Stark. Using the former Stark Tower, now renamed&nbsp;Avengers Tower, as their headquarters. After many months they tracked it to a HYDRA research facility run by&nbsp;Wolfgang von Strucker&nbsp;in Sokovia and launched an all out assault to recover it. The Avengers also noted that they were being harassed by two "enhanced" during the operation, but together with Stark's&nbsp;Iron Legion&nbsp;the team soon overthrew the HYDRA soldiers and reclaimed the sceptre. Tony appealed to Thor to have two days to study the alien device before it was relocated to&nbsp;Asgard, which Thor agreed to, and then the team unanimously agreed to celebrate their victory.</p>
<p>Back in New York at Avengers Tower, Tony began to unravel the mysteries of the sceptre. Tony and&nbsp;Bruce Bannerdiscovered that its core held something akin to a powerful computer and deduced that HYDRA had been trying to use it to create artificial intelligence. With this knowledge he had the epiphany that he might be able to provide real adaptive thought to his Iron Legion in what he called his Ultron Program. He and Bruce then left J.A.R.V.I.S. to continue investigating while he rejoined his team for a night of celebration. The party was huge and the Avengers gathered many of their friends for the night. When the revelry had died down, and most of the guests had left, the remaining men took turns trying to lift&nbsp;Mj&ouml;lnir. This activity was interrupted by the appearance of a wrecked Iron Legion drone. It quickly became apparent that this was being operated by a rogue artificial intelligence, and the name it claimed for itself was "Ultron". Ultron and a number of other Iron Legion drones, then attacked the small group. They rallied and beat it back, but not before one of the Iron Legion made off with the sceptre during the confusion. Thor promptly turned on Stark demanding to know why he had created such a thing, to which Tony pointed out that they needed a way to deal with threats on the scale of the Chitauri.</p>
<p>The Avengers traced Ultron's movements to a salvage yard on the coast of Africa where&nbsp;Ulysses Klaue&nbsp;dealt in the lucrative end of black market trading. So began a three way battle between Klaue's men after Ultron severed his arm, the Avengers, and the&nbsp;Ultron Sentries. Ultron also had the advantage of the pair of enhanced that the Avengers had encountered in Sokovia, the siblings Wanda and&nbsp;Pietro Maximoff. Pietro's speed allowed him to devastate the ranks of Klaue's men, while Wanda ravaged the minds of the Avengers themselves. When she at last reached Banner, her illusions caused him to fly into a rage that he then directed towards the populace of Johannesburg, and then she Ultron and Pietro made their escape. With most of the Avengers out of action fighting their own inner demons, Tony was left to attend to the problem of a rampaging Hulk on his own. He asked&nbsp;Veronica, a shuttle that could deploy numerous pieces of a heavy duty Iron Man armor. Tony in the Hulkbuster Armor afforded him the physical power to subdue the Hulk, but the public relations damage had been done, leaving Bruce in a morose state. Clint Barton took the group to a safehouse to recover, soon revealing that it was actually his family home. There they met Nick Fury, who began reorienting their thinking and fomenting new strategic considerations within the shattered ranks. Banner and Romanoff had both been psychologically scarred by their encounter Wanda and contemplated simply leaving. Tensions ran high between Tony and&nbsp;Steve Rogers, and Thor had been given a glimpse of something very troubling and departed the group to investigate further.</p>
<p>Ultron's plan to use the sceptre to create a final evolutionarily pure form for himself had become clear, and the last piece of that puzzle was with Dr.&nbsp;Helen Cho&nbsp;in South Korea. They raced for Seoul, and found Ultron deep into an attempt to load his consciousness into a new android body. Their interference forced Ultron to flee, but the group managed to separate the android body from the robot before he escaped again, and Stark, and Barton, took it back to New York. Rogers on the other hand, found himself joined by the Maximoff twins on the street of Seoul after Wanda had discovered Ultron's true intent. Romanoff had not been so lucky, and having been rendered unconscious in the confrontation soon found herself imprisoned by Ultron in Sokovia. Once they were back in New York, Stark and Banner bickered over the android body. Stark wanted to load&nbsp;J.A.R.V.I.S.&nbsp;into it, but Banner didn't trust his judgement. The dispute continued until it was interrupted by the arrival of Rogers and the Maximoff twins, whereupon Pietro ended it by simply unplugging the entire system. Then Thor made a surprise appearance and promptly bathed the android in lightning. It awoke in the surge and cast him aside. The Avengers and the Maximoff twins all moved to counter the android but halted when it stopped by a window to gaze out upon the city. It quickly became apparent that the android was no threat, especially fostering trust in Thor when it hefted Mjolnir with ease. The assembled group then compared stories, and Thor reported news of his vision that the energy core of the sceptre had actually contained the Mind Stone, an item of incredible power and one of the legendary&nbsp;Infinity Stones. That gem was now resting in the forehead of the android, which soon began referring to itself as&nbsp;Vision.</p>
<p>The Avengers and their three allies turned their attention back to Ultron and Sokovia. Banner went alone to extract Romanoff from her prison, and the others faced off against Ultron. While Ultron's plan to divide and exterminate the Avengers had failed, its plans for the human race were about to be fully revealed. Devices planted within the city engaged, drawing a sizeable portion of it into the sky. The assembled heroes, with Banner and Romanoff back amongst them, fought back against the amassed ranks of Ultron's robot legion. James Rhodes, suited up as War Machine, and a recently repaired helicarrier with him, also eventually joined the battle. After clearing most of the Ultron robots from the city now risen above the cloud layer, the heroes began evacuating the trapped populace in personnel transports sent from the helicarrier. Barton was caught under the guns of the Avengers' own quinjet however, with Ultron at the controls, and only the intervention of Pietro saved him. Pietro had saved both Barton and a boy with this final act, but at the cost of his own life when the quinjet's gunfire tore through his chest. The Vision finally confronted Ultron alone after the Hulk had flung the robot from the quinjet. Heavily damaged, Ultron was no match for the android, and fell to the Vision's power. With Ultron's defeat, the group began an inevitable dissolution. The Hulk switched off the quinjet's communications, leaving it to fly him clear of the scene. Thor and Stark each had their own agendas to pursue, with Thor needing to investigate the matter of yet another Infinity Stone coming within reach. Barton meanwhile had a new baby to attend to and left to return to his family.</p>
<p>Despite their losses, the Avengers were also to be born anew. Steve and Romanoff proceeded to a new Avengers facility in New York, and welcomed a new quartet to the fold. They were joined by the Vision, Wanda Maximoff,&nbsp;James Rhodes&nbsp;aka War Machine, and Steve's recent companion,&nbsp;Sam Wilson&nbsp;aka the Falcon.</p>
<h3><em>Ant-Man</em></h3>
<p>When&nbsp;Henry Pym&nbsp;was debriefing&nbsp;Scott Lang&nbsp;about his mission, Scott remarked that they should call in the Avengers. Hank scoffed at the idea, claiming that they were probably too busy "dropping cities out of the sky". Later in order to ensure the accomplishment of the heist, Hank requires a device he had constructed for&nbsp;S.H.I.E.L.D.&nbsp;that lay in storage in what he knew to be an abandoned&nbsp;Stark Industries&nbsp;warehouse in Upstate New York. Ant-Man is sent in to retrieve the package only to make a unexpected discovery upon arrival that the warehouse had become the&nbsp;New Avengers Facility&nbsp;where he encounters&nbsp;Falcon&nbsp;and engages in battle against him, while managing to acquire the device.</p>

</div>
<p>The Avengers are in Lagos Nigeria on a mission to apprehend&nbsp;Brock Rumlow&nbsp;who now is going by the codename: Crossbones, and has been insisting terrorist attacks publicly with the aid of armed mercenaries for several months now. Cap and Black Widow take the newly recruited teammates&nbsp;Falcon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Scarlet Witch&nbsp;on the mission to prevent Crossbones from acquiring a chemical bio-Weapon from a disease control center. The team is successful in dealing with the hired mercenaries by taking them down efficiently in combat. Rumlow realizing he's outmatched goes after Captain America directly seeking revenge upon the super soldier for dropping a building upon him. Rogers fairs off well against him conturing every attack. Rumlow attempts to distract him by referring to&nbsp;Bucky&nbsp;causing disoriented focus to Steve. who unaware of a triggered suicide bomb vest by Rumlow.</p>
<p>Wanda tries to contain the blast of the explosion by creating a energy shield and launching it into the sky. Unfortunately the blast goes off upon a nearby building killing innocent Wakandain representatives. As a result of this international incident. The Governments of the World issue a new mandate called the Sokovia Accords satiating governmental oversight over The Avengers.</p>
<p>Former general&nbsp;Thaddeus Ross, now the Secretary of State visits the Avengers at their headquarters to deliver the accords to them and stipulates that either they sign or they retire. The Team is divided on the issue with both Tony and Steve on opposite side of disagreement regarding the ramification of the accords. Steve is against the accords because he feels this will infringe on the teams ability to be free to respond to crisis immediately. Tony is for the accords because he believes that they need to be put in check by accepting boundaries so they don't become as bad as the advisories they face.</p>

<p><em>More to be added</em></p>
<h3><em>Doctor Strange</em></h3>
<p>The film mentions that the Avengers protect the world from physical threats, while the sanctum protects the world from spiritual threats.</p>
<h3><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></h3>
<p>Thanos attacks what remains of&nbsp;Asgard, killing many including Loki. Heimdall is able to send Hulk to Earth before being killed to alert the planet of the incoming threat. He lands at the New York Sanctum, where he meets and warns&nbsp;Stephen Strange&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wong&nbsp;of the incoming threat. They get Tony Stark and explain the situation to him; That Thanos is finally coming. They ask Tony where Vision is, but Tony reveals that Vision has been missing and only Steve Rogers could find him. Before he can decide if he should or shouldn't call him, a ship arrives over New York, bringing&nbsp;Ebony Maw&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cull Obsidian. The duo attack Tony and the group, and while&nbsp;Peter Parker&nbsp;arrives to help, they are split, with Strange and Peter being captured and Tony chases after them while Wong and Bruce remain on Earth. Bruce calls Cap while Wong stays to protect the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Vision and Wanda wake to the stone trying to warn Vision of the danger. They are attacked in Scotland by&nbsp;Proxima Midnight&nbsp;and&nbsp;Corvus Glaive. Corvus stabs Vision and tries to remove the stone while Proxima tries to distract Wanda but Wanda is able to save Vision but they become cornered by the two. Suddenly, Steve appears with Sam and Natasha to save them. They greatly wound Corvus and disarm Proxima, forcing them to flee. Steve then decides to fly them back to the New Avengers facility. There they interrupt a meeting between Rhodey and Ross. Cap says they're here to fight after Earth loses its best defender. Ross orders Rhodes to arrest them but he doesn't. They meet up with Bruce to decide what to do. Vision wants to destroy the stone but Steve refuses. Bruce figures they might be able to save Vision and destroy the stone at once.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in space, Maw tortures Strange in order for him to give up the time stone. Peter tells Tony to blast the ship open so that it sucks Maw out, as he's too powerful to handle alone. This succeeds and they decide to take the fight to Thanos rather than going back to Earth to wait for him in order to surprise Thanos. Tony then knights Peter as an Avenger.</p>
